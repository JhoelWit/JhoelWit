### Hi there 👋 My name is Jhoel Witter

I'm an aspiring roboticist with a passion for robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and sim-to-real practices. I'm currently interested in working on meaningful and engaging deep learning projects as a robotics software engineer, and growing with the field.

## Academic Accomplishments 📖
- Obtained BS in mechanical engineering from **The University at Buffalo** ✔️
- Obtained MS in robotics specializing in machine learning and artificial intelligence from **The University at Buffalo** ✔️

## Collaborative Projects 👨‍🔬👩‍🔬
- Designing an urban air mobility air traffic controller agent for vertiport traffic management: ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)
- Implementing priority surveillance modes for a scalable coverage and path planning algorithm: ![](https://geps.dev/progress/100)
- Developing a multi-agent dimensionality reduction agent which uses a CNN to effectively downsample observation data: ![](https://geps.dev/progress/50)
- Designing a forex trading agent which takes in multiple timeframes worth of data to make live trades: ![](https://geps.dev/progress/40)

## Personal Projects 👨‍🔬
- Assembling a Petoi Bittle robot, and using deep rl to teach it how to walk with the help of Nvidia's Isaam-Gym. The final model will be applied to the robot using sim-to-real practices: ![](https://geps.dev/progress/50)
- 3D printing and assembling a 6 DOF arm, and using a kinect RGB-D camera along with deep multi-agent rl to teach it chess: ![](https://geps.dev/progress/10)
